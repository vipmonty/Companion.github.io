									"Beware of the Sparkle: Social Media's Hidden Dangers"

						I am awakened on a hot summer’s day, “another year another heatwave” I thought to
					myself. With the sweat beading down my brow, I turn my television on to be greeted by a
					familiar broadcast as summers before. The local news station delivering another advisory with
					the running headline “Beware of The Sparkle.” Motivated to escape the heat and unaware of the 
					vicious current and dormant debris below the inviting surface, another victim falls claim to the 
					sparkling calm exterior of the local Canal. I bring this up because I am reminded of this narrative 
					when I speak of an entity with similar workings.
						“Social Media” works in a way as that of the canal from my childhood, calling in
					possible victims with it alluring nature while hidden beneath lurks unseen dangers, acting as a 
					place where connections with friends and family are orchestrated. Although we cannot deny this 
					this tune, just like we cannot deny the winter’s snow melt made the canal cooling, our purpose 
					here is to serve as the running headline, “Beware of the Sparkle,” did from my childhood; calling 
					for users to use caution and bringing awareness to the potential dangers social media may 
					present.
						Drawing again from my childhood I recall the D.A.R.E. program in elementary school 
					which warned us of the dangers of drugs. Although the effectiveness varied amongst our peers, 
					the awareness it provided, is what we aim to establish regarding social media. This is the type of 
					program we should be pushing for, but rather than focusing on Marijuana or cigarettes, we can 
					enter the social media discussion with the proposition that establishing such a program will bring 
					awareness concerning the following questions: is social media addiction forming? Does it
					deteriorate mental health? Can it open gateways to cyber security threats? At the conclusion of 
					our conversation, the goal is to verify that indeed these are prevalent and life altering issues. 
					Only after confirmation, can we examine another question: with stakes so high as to be 
					considered as life altering, would it not be beneficial to establish an awareness program to 
					combat these issues? This is the proposition.
						Our battle begins with the subtilty of the first underlining questions mentioned above. Is
					social media addiction forming? Addiction is another beast of its own, one that evolves subtly 
					and rewards indulgence until the indulgence is accepted to be a part of one’s life. To Elaborate, 
					Daria J. Kuss, a researcher from The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public 
					Health, informs “There is a growing scientific evidence base to suggest excessive social 
					networking sites (SNSs) use may lead to symptoms traditionally associated with substance-
					related addictions. These symptoms have been described as salience, mood modification, 
					tolerance, withdrawal, relapse, and conflict with regards to behavioral addictions, and have been 
					validated in the context of the Internet addiction components model,” (Kuss 6). In addition, an in 
					dept study held by D’Adrienzo a researcher and author from “The International Journal of 
					Mental Health and Addictions”. This study systematically reviewed the evidence concerning 
					internet/social media addiction and attachment styles. Drawing from her article D’Adrienzo 
					explains: 
									“There is a growing body of research that has examined the impact of 
							attachment styles and its influence on internet addiction (more generally) and 
							social media addiction (more specifically). Consequently, the present study 
							systematically reviewed the evidence concerning internet/social media addiction 
							and attachment style. A total of 32 papers published between 2000 and 2018 met 
							the inclusion criteria following searches in the following databases: Scopus, Web 
							of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. Findings demonstrated a 
							significant positive association between insecure attachment (anxious and 
							avoidant) and a more intensive and dysfunctional use of the internet and social 
							media. Findings demonstrate that those with insecure attachment appear to use the 
							social media sites as a way of replacing and compensating affection that is 
							missing from those around the individual (e.g., family and peers).” (D’Arienzo 1)
					We can conclude from Kuss that social networking sites can indeed lead to addiction with 
					symptoms similar to substance abuse. In addition, D’Arienzo’s study reveals that 
					individuals with prior insecure attachment issues may look to social media to fill a void 
					consequentially forming a social media addiction. 
						On the contrary some parents may argue emphasizing the importance of teaching 
					responsible use rather than blaming platforms. A solid point that we can agree with, but 
					with the stake as high as addiction and mental health, can we rely on that alone? Not to 
					mention, it is usually easier said than done. For example, how many times have we read 
					headlines concerning suicide where parents give statements like: ‘we had no idea, they 
					seemed so happy,’ usually surprised and grasping at red flags to make sense of it all. 
					These are such stories touching on the subtlety of addiction and mental health effected by 
					excessive social media use, prompting us to remind users to “Beware of the Sparkle”.
						Our argument isn’t that all individuals are susceptible, but rather, the 
					demographic in concern are usually teens, and according to Emily A. Vogels, who 
					received her PhD in experimental psychology from the University of New Brunswick, 
					“53% of teens who almost constantly use at least one of the many social media platforms 
					say they are on social media too much,” (Vogels 16). It is these 53% that maybe crying  
					out for such a program as the one we are aiming to establish. In addition, highlighted by 
					the findings of Jonathan Haidt, professor of Ethical Leadership of The New York 
					University, “when you compare rates in 2009 –before most teens were daily users of 
					social media––to 2019––the last full year before Covid made things even worse––the 
					increases are generally between 50% and 150%, depending on the disorder, gender, and 
					subgroup.” (Jonathan 3). Thus, indicating social media use is on the incline correlating 
					with trends of excessive use. A pressing topic, especially when considering the influence 
					social media can have on mental health.  So much so, self-image and self-worth may be 
					reassessed leading to a downward spiral of negative thoughts. 
						Speaking of mental health, in the very beginning before anything problematic could be 
					realized, social media was the holy grail for connection allowing its users to express themselves 
					in a creative manner, share positive experiences, and build communities. Although this may hold 
					true, speaking as a Software Engineering major, time usually tells when concerning new 
					technology such as this. Furthermore, Stephanie S. Fredrick, researcher from the Journal of 
					Youth and Adolescence, informs “Further, prevalence of adolescent depression has increased 
					internationally in the past decade, corresponding with the surge in cell phone and social media 
					use” (Fredrick 2). To better understand how and why this is so, we dive into the findings of 
					Donald M. Hilty, an author affiliated with The Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral 
					Sciences, who conducted “A scoping review of 11 literature databases from 2000 to 2020 
					explored research studies in youth in five areas: clinical depression and anxiety, quantitative use, 
					social media mode, engagement and qualitative dimensions and health and well-being. Result 
					found out of 2,820 potential literature references, 140 met the inclusion criteria. The findings 
					conclude that depression may predict social media use and reduce perception of support,” (Hilty 
					1). In summary, Hilty’s coax the idea that social media can be sought out from preexisting 
					depression and social avoidance only to add on to the isolation thus continuing the cycle with 
					more social media use, a familiar trait of addiction.
						Not only can mental health be at risk when consulting social media, but usually when 
					working with anything on the Web, cyber security threats become prevalent. In contrast, many 
					can argue that social media cyber security has implemented a range of security measures to 
					protect user data, and user should stay informed and utilize available safeguards. Nevertheless, 
					all the security features in the world could not prevent a scammer from utilizing misinformation 
					with malicious intent to gain information such as your address, email, and bank account 
					information. For instance, provided by Ahmed Alharibi, a student of the School of Computing 
					Technologies,
						“a malicious account can pretend to be Alice who is Bob’s close friend. Alice 
						sends a friendship invitation to Bob. As a result, the malicious account will obtain 
						access to Bob’s private information that Bob intends to share only with the real 
						Alice. Furthermore, fake identities (profiles) tend to commit other malicious 
						behaviors. For instance, fake identities can attack the vulnerabilities of social 
						media, spread malware and manipulate legitimate users.” (Alharbi 2)
					Drawing from my own personal experience we can see similarity to Alharibi’s example. 
					In my case, desperate for a job after applying for months on LinkedIn, I came across a 
					group page on Facebook entitled “Utah Jobs” exposing me to a scammer. Hanging to rainbows 
					and hope, I became the prime victims for cyber security threats in the form of a malicious 
					account. In short, a scammer posing as an employer spoon feed me misinformation to gain my 
					residence, email, and a photocopy of my identification card. Consequently, for weeks my email 
					was filled with verification codes from fake accounts that the scammer opened using my 
					information. Accounts such as: PayPal, Amazon, and even Acorn. Cyber security has become 
					such a pressing issue that the president of our university Astrid S. Tumiez delivered a warning on 
					the Utah Valley University homepage to student and faculty of the dangers. Similar to my case, 
					Tumiez advised “Impersonation scams are even more sinister. Scammers, pretending to be 
					someone you trust, may attempt to trick you into sending money, buying gift cards, or giving the 
					information needed to steal your identity. Always be cautious and verify before you act” 
					(Tumiez 00:45). Our president goes on to reveal the twist that her voice in the video was not her 
					own but actually an A.I. generated clone. She concluded “Just as my voice can be mimicked, so 
					can others. Always be vigilant. Cyber threats are real, but with awareness, we can protect 
					ourselves” (Tumiez 01:19).
						In conclusion, in a world of diversity and demographics I cannot argue that social media 
					is all bad, there are obviously numerous benefits of social media, which is what makes it the 
					powerhouse that it is. Social Media can help connect loved ones and be an outlet for creative 
					thought, but on the other side of the coin, it can be the breeding grounds for depression, cyber 
					threats, and addiction. We have delivered our incites, research, thoughts, and claims, all to 
					combat issues that need a resolution. Therefore, I present to you a program for our students most 
					vulnerable. Although the tide may seem calm, underneath the surface there are teens wandering 
					in shadows. The program that I am arguing to establish will be a big banner at the shoreline that 
					simply states, “Social Media: beware of the Sparkle”.
